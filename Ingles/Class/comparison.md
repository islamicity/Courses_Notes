### 01. Comparative adjectives.

Comparative adjectives are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify (larger, smaller, faster, higher). They are used in sentences where two nouns are compared, in this patter:

```text
Noun(subject) + verb + comparative adjective + than + noun(object).
```



*The second item of comparison can be omitted if it is clear from the context.

> ​	**Examples:**
>
> - My house is larger than her.
> - This box is smaller that the one I lost.
> - You dog runs faster than Jim's dog.
> - The rock flew higher that the roof.
> - Jim and Jack are both my friends, but I like Jack better.
> - She's younger than me.
> - This exercise is more difficult than the last one.
> - David looks older than he really is.



### Superlative adjectives.

Superlative adjectives are used to describe an object which is at the upper or lower limit of a quality ( the tallest, the smallest, the fastest, the highest). They are used in sentences where a subject is compared to a group ob objects.

```
Noun(subject) + verb + the + superlative adjective + noun (object).
```

> **Examples**:
>
> - My house is the largest one in our neighborhood.
> - This is the smallest box I've ever seen.
> - Your dog ran the fastest of any dog in the race.
> - We all threw our rocks at the same time. My rock flew the highest.



### Forming regular comparatives and superlatives

Forming comparatives and superlatives is easy. The form depends on the number of syllables in the original adjective.

**One syllable adjectives**

Add ***-er*** for the comparative and ***-est*** for the superlative. If the adjective has a consonant + single vowel + consonant spelling, the final consonant must be doubled before adding the ending.

| Adjectives     | Comparative | Superlative |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| tall           | taller      | tallest     |
| fat            | fatter      | fattest     |
| big            | bigger      | biggest     |
| sad (*triste*) | sadder      | saddest     |
| cheap          | cheaper     | cheapest    |

**Two syllables adjectives**

Adjectives with two syllables can form the comparative either by adding ***-er*** or by preceding the adjective with ***more***. These adjectives form the superlative either by adding ***-est*** or by preceding the adjective with ***most***. In many cases, both forms are used, although one usage will be more common than the other. If you are not sure whether a two-syllable adjective can take a comparative or superlative ending, play it safe and use *more* and *most* instead. For adjectives ending in *y*, change the y to an i before adding the ending.

| Adjective            | Comparative  | Superlative  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| happy                | happier      | happiest     |
| simple               | simpler      | simplest     |
| busy                 | busier       | busiest      |
| tilted (*inclinado*) | more tilted  | most tilted  |
| tangled (*enredado*) | more tangled | most tangled |

**Three or more syllables**

Adjectives with three or more syllables from comparative by putting more in front of the adjective, and the superlative by putting most in front.

| Adjective | Comparative    | Superlative    |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| important | more important | most important |
| expensive | more expensive | most expensive |

**Irregular comparatives and superlatives**

| Adjetive | Comparative       | Superlative         |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| good     | better            | best                |
| bad      | worse             | worst               |
| little   | les               | least               |
| much     | more              | most                |
| far      | further / farther | furthest / fasthest |

> **Examples:**
>
> - Today is the **worst** day I've had in a long time.
> - You play tennis **better** than I do.
> - This is the **least** expensive sweater in the store.
> - This sweater is **less** expensive than that one.
> - I ran pretty far yesterday, but I ran even **farther** today.



### Others

When you want to say something is similar, use ***'as - as'***

> She's as tall as her brother.
>
> It's as nice today as it was yesterday. (Hoy es tan bonito como ayer)

![image-20210214235946874](./images/as_as.png)

You can use “almost as … as”, “not quite as … as”, “(not) nearly as … as”, “nowhere near as … as”, “twice as … as” and “half as … as” to change the extent of the similarity.

> **Examples:**
>
> - She's almost as good as you! (Ella es casi tan buena como tú!)
> - He's not quite as confident as Susie (No tiene tanta confianza como Susie)
> - I'm not nearly as intelligent as her! (No soy tan inteligente como ella)
> - This painting is nowhere near as famous as the first. (Esta pintura no estan famosa como la priemra)
> - She's twice as old as him (Tiene el doble de edad que él)
> - He's half as interesting as you! (Es la mitad de interesante que tú)

Before comparatives, you can use:

```
much   -   a lot   -   far (=a lot)   -   a bit   -   a little   -   slightly (=a little)
```

> **Examples:**
>
> - Let's go by car. It's much cheaper.
> - How do you feel? Much better, thanks.
> - Don't go by train. it's a lot more expensive.
> - Could you speak a bit more slowly?
> - This bag is slightly heavier than the other one.
> - Her illness was far more serious than we thought at first.

You can use any and no + comparative (any longer/ no bigger etc)

> **Examples:**
>
> - I've waited long enough. I'm not waiting any longer.
> - We expected their house to be very big, but it's no bigger than ours.
> - How do you feel now? Do you feel any better?
> - This hotel is better than the other one, and it's no more expensive.

We repeat comparatives to say that something changes continuously.

> **Examples:**
>
> - Your English is improving. It's getting better and better.
> - The city is growing fast. It's getting bigger and bigger.
> - Cathy got more and more bored in her job. In the end she left.
> - There days more and more people are learning English.
