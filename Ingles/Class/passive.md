# Passive

## Introduction

The passive of an active tense is formed by putting the verb **"to be"** into the same tense as the active verb and adding the past participle of the active verb. The subject of the active verb becomes the 'agent' of the passive verb. The agent is very often not mentioned. When it is mentioned it is preceded by **"by"** and placed at the end of the clause.

- Active: My grandfather planted this tree.
- Passive: This tree was planted by my grandfather.

**Short answers** 

To make short answers: 

- we use the verb to be (am/is/are/was/were) for Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Continuous, Past Continuous and Going To questions. 
- we use the verb have (have/has/had) for Present Perfect and Past Perfect questions. 
- we use will for Future Simple questions.

**USE**

The Passive is used: 

1. when the agent (=the person who does the action) is unknown, unimportant or obvious from the context. 

   ​	Jane was shot. (We don’t know who shot her.) 

   ​	This church was built in 1815. (Unimportant agent) 

   ​	He has been arrested. (Obviously by the police) 

2. to make more polite or formal statements. 

   ​	The car hasn’t been cleaned. (more polite) (You haven’t cleaned the car. – less polite) 

3. when the action is more important than the agent, as in processes, instructions, events, reports, headlines, new items, and advertisements. 

   ​	30 people were killed in the earthquake.

4. to put emphasis on the agent.

   ​	The new library will be opened by the Queen

   

**BY OR WITH?** 

In the passive voice, we use:

- by with the agent to refer to by whom the action is being done. 

  ​	The door was opened by Mr Black. (Mr Blak = agent)

- with to refer to the instrument, object or material that was used for something to be done. 

  ​	The door was opened with a key. (a key = the object that was used) 

  ​	The omelette was made with eggs, cheese and peppers. (eggs, cheese and peppers = the 	material 	that was used)

**EXAMPLES**

- Our house was designed by a famous architect.
- Our car was stolen last night. (We don’t know who stole it)
- He has been taken to hospital. (What we are interested in is the fact that he has been taken
  to hospital and not who has taken him.)
- The murderer was arrested last night. (It is not necessary to mention that he has been
  arrested by the police because it is self-evident.)
- Someone broke the window. → The window was broken.
- This book was written by Agatha Christie.
