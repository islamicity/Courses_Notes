## API Product Strategies.

- Products, on the other hand, focus on the outcome, not the delivery. While a project is often represented by a scheduled list of activities that are required to solve the problem, products should be designed based on business requirements. The person or team designing a product may have no idea how the product will be implemented, but that's okay. A product focus will be more likely to lead to a successful outcome since we are focusing on the requirements of the API product rather than the process used to create it. Products also need to adapt to market needs as they change. This means that we should be willing to modify our product over time. It can also mean that the new product you envisioned a few months ago might not be what you need now. This is one of the problems we often see with IT projects. When we design large projects upfront for delivery months later, the team locks down requirements to avoid scope creep and give the team a chance to meet the delivery date, but the project often has reduced value when it is eventually delivered. The need to have a product meet current business requirements means that products do not have a completion date. We're not saying that you'll never deliver a product.
